> # What is the Ionic CLI?
> The CLI, or command line interface, is a tool that provides a number of helpful commands to Ionic developers. In addition to installing and updating Ionic, the CLI comes with a built-in development server, build and debugging tools, and much more. If you are using Ionic Pro, the CLI can be used to export code and even interact with your account programmatically.

> # What are components?
> Components in Ionic are reusable UI elements that serve as the building blocks for your mobile app. Components are made up of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. Every Ionic component adapts to the platform on which your app is running. We call this Platform Continuity and go more in depth on how it works in Theming.

> # What is theming?
> Themes are sets of styles that get applied to an app. Ionic uses a light theme by default, but it also comes with a dark theme. In addition to theming, Ionic’s Platform Continuity enables components to have platform-specific styles. This means the app’s styles will change based on the platform (iOS, Android, etc.) on which it’s being run, offering your users an experience with which they’re familiar.
