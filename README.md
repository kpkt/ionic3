# What is Ionic Framework?

Ionic framework is free and open source. It allows you to build mobile apps easily using web technologies. The good news is: if you can manage to create websites, then you know how to build mobile apps. Ionic Framework offers the best web and native app components for building highly interactive, native and progressive web apps.

You can think of Ionic as the front-end UI framework that handles all of the look and feel and UI interactions your app needs in order to be compelling. It's like a kind of "Bootstrap for Native" but with all the support for a broad range of common native mobile components, slick animations, and incredible design.

Also, it allows developers to design apps for every app store and mobile web, using a unique base code. 

# Prerequisites
